# uad-kill
Bash script that kills Universal Audio driver (macOS). Includes handy Automator executable.

Since the UAD driver is a live driver, it is constantly utilizing CPU, whether your Apollo interface is connected or not. Save some CPU cycles, and kill it when not in use.

# To use:
```bash
./uad-kill 
``` 

Alternatively, run the included Automator executable.

To restart your UAD drivers, simply open up UA Console.
